# Trending-repositories

Welcome!

Trending repositories is a mobile application developped with React Native.

The application shows the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.

You will be able to keep crolling untill there is no more starred repos in the last 30 days

If you click on a repo, you are redirected to the link of the repository.

PS : I know that the speed is not important for this test, i tried to finish as soon as possible due to exams.
